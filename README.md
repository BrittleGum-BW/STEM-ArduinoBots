# STEM Arduino Bots: OLI & QB

Modular, open-source bipedal robots designed for education, play, and accessibility for all ages and small budgets.

## Contents

- `QB/`: ZIP bundles for QB — a cube-shaped robot with chunky wheels driven by geared DC motors.
- `OLI/`: ZIP bundles for Ocho Lados Iguales (OLI) — an eight-sided robot with a moving head driven by micro servo motors.
- `Build-Notes/`: Notes on sensors, motors, encoders, calibration, and other build insights.
- `Blockly/`: Custom Blockly interface adapted from OTTOBlockly.

> Each ZIP includes STL files, parts list, images, and Arduino/CPP code.

## Philosophy

This project prioritizes modular design and accessibility for learners, educators, and makers. It encourages hands-on exploration, low-cost experimentation, and reproducible builds.

## Getting Started

1. Download the ZIP for your robot (`QB_v1.0.zip`, `OLI_v1.0.zip`)
2. Unpack and follow the internal README or manifest
3. Review any relevant material in `Build-Notes/`
4. Upload `.ino` files via the Arduino IDE
5. Explore the Blockly interface (optional)
