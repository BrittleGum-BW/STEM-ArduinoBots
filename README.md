# STEM Arduino Bots: OLI & QB

Modular, open-source bipedal robots designed for education, play and accessibility (all ages and small budgets)

## Contents

- `QB/`: ZIP bundles* for QB a Cube shaped robot with chunky wheels driven by geared DC motors
- `OLI/`: ZIP bundles for Ocho Lados Iguales (OLI), an eight sided robot with moving head driven by micro servo motors.
- `Build-Notes/`: Build Notes on the use of sensors, motors, encoders, calibration, and so on.
- `Blockly/`: Custom Blockly interface adapted from OTTOBlockly
  
Note: The ZIP bundles include STL files, parts list, and Arduino code

## Philosophy

This project prioritizes modular design, and accessibility for learners and educators. 

## Getting Started

- Download the ZIP for your robot (`QB_v1.0.zip`, `OLI_v1.0.zip`)
- Unpack and follow the internal README or manifest. Be Sure to download and read any material in the Build-Notes
- Upload `.ino` files via Arduino IDE
- Explore Blockly interface (optional)
